# K9-Revive

An absolute overhaul to K9-Forums. The perfect website.

## What is K9-Revive

K9-Revive (K9R) is a spiritual successor to my previous project <a href="https://github.com/CKAY-9/k9-forums">K9-Forums</a>. K9-Forums was, as I decided with many other projects, poorly structured, not what I would want to have out there, and not complete.

K9R is ultimately my first major revision of one of projects, with more likely to come (they have been deleted off of GitHub), and will hopefully be great; however, K9-Forums will remain on GitHub as it is in a "usable" state and as a look back into my coding history.

## So, What's Different?

Compared to K9-Forums, K9R is more than just a forum.
