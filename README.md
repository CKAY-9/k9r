An absolute overhaul to K9-Forums. R9-Revive.

## What is K9-Revive

K9-Revive (K9R) is a spiritual successor to my previous project <a href="https://github.com/CKAY-9/k9-forums">K9-Forums</a>. K9-Forums was, as I decided with many other projects, poorly structured, not what I would want to have out there, and not complete.

K9R is ultimately my first major revision of one of projects, with more likely to come (they have been deleted off of GitHub), and will hopefully be great; however, K9-Forums will remain on GitHub as it is in a "usable" state and as a look back into my coding history.

## So, What's Different?

Compared to K9-Forums, K9R is more than just a forum. K9R does offer an improved version of K9-Forums within it; however
it also contains game integration, a simple discord bot, real-time chat, store functionality for usergroups, and more.

## Features

### Forums

K9R, being based off of K9-Forums, comes with an easy to setup forum. Management is done through the admin panel and offer many quality of life
features.

### Usergroups
K9R allows you to easily configure different usergroups and permissions through the admin panel. You can add users to different usergroups through the users tab.

### Game Integration
K9R, also being inspired by CxDashboard, comes with simple game mods/plugins for real-time websocket communicatio with K9R. These are used for real-time statistics, chat, commands, and fetching data from the K9R API.

### Store
K9R offers a simple store service for your community. Whether it's just having a special usergroup, doing something in-game, or executing your own scripts, K9R store can do it. Implemented with Stripe API.

### Self-Hosted
K9R is meant to be self-hosted and isn't tied to any specific server or host. This allows you to setup K9R in whatever way you want.
